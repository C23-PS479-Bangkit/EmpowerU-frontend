# EmpowerU

## Description

EmpowerU is an application designed to promote various types of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Indonesia. The app allows Indonesian users to review and rate SMEs, and those SMEs with positive reviews have the opportunity to become "Trending" and appear at the top of the app's listings. This exposure helps these SMEs increase their visibility and potentially boost their income.
